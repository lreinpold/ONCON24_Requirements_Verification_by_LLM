 The following is a specification of a technical workflow in a Smart Grid context. The workflow consists of actions, which represent the different steps of the workflow. Each action is executed by an actor. Objects are exchanged between various actions. The actions, actors and objects of the workflow are described in the following. Actors, objects, and actions must adhere to specific rules, which are also described in the following. Please read the specification so I can subsequently ask you questions about it. 
The workflow is called Smart Grid Optimization Workflow. 
The actors involved in the workflow are Prosumer, Energy Market, Prediction Services, Aggregator, and Grid Operator.
The workflow can consist of the objects Optimization Request, Market Offer, Energy Schedule, Optimization Horizon, System State, Market Clearing Results, Load Prediction, Price Prediction, Generation Prediction and Boolean. 
The workflow consists of the actions Accept Optimization Request, Clear Market, Set Optimization Horizon, Determine System State, Accept Offer, Predict Load, Predict Generation, Predict Price, Optimize Schedule, Aggregate Flexibility, Validate Schedule, Request Optimization, and Log Information. 

 The following rules must be adhered to: 
 Every action Accept Optimization Request must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Optimization Request. \n There must be at least one action AcceptOptimization Request in the workflow.  \n Every action Aggregate Flexibility must have at least one input and all input must be of the type Energy Schedule.  \n Every action Aggregate Flexibility may only be performed by the actor Aggregator. \n Every action Determine System State must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type System State. \n Every action Accept Offer may only be performed by the actor Energy Market. \n Every action Clear Market may only be performed by the actor Energy Market. \n There must be at least one action Log Information in the workflow.  \n Every action Optimize Schedule must have one input of the type Optimization Horizon. \n Every action Optimize Schedule must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Energy Schedule. \n Every action Predict Generation may only be performed by the actor Prediction Services. \n Every action Predict Price may only be performed by the actor Prediction Services. \n Every action Predict Load must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Load Prediction. \n Every action Predict Price must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Optimization Horizon. \n The Prosumer must perform at least one action. \n There must be at least one action Set Optimization Horizon in the workflow.  \n Every action Set Optimization Horizon must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Optimization Horizon.  \n Every action Validate Schedule must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Energy Schedule. \n Every action Validate Schedule must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Boolean.  \n There must be at least one action Validate Schedule in the workflow.   
  The following is a description of a practical implementation of the Smart Grid Optimization Workflow. 

 The Smart Grid Optimization Workflow kicks off when an Optimization Request object is created. This Optimization Request is then sent to the Prosumer, who takes it in and performs the action Accept Optimization Request.

Next, the Prosumer goes on to do two things: Determine System State and Set Optimization Horizon. When setting the horizon, an Optimization Horizon object is generated. This object stays with the Prosumer as input for Optimize Schedule, but it's also shared with Prediction Services for the actions Predict Generation and Predict Load, and with the Grid Operator for Predict Price and Validate Schedule.

Once Prediction Services get the Optimization Horizon, they carry out Predict Generation, which results in a Generation Prediction being created and sent back to the Prosumer for Optimize Schedule. Meanwhile, the Grid Operator uses the Optimization Horizon to run Predict Price, which produces a Price Prediction that also goes to the Prosumer. Likewise, Prediction Services handle Predict Load, resulting in a Load Prediction sent to the Prosumer.

When the Prosumer runs Determine System State, it creates an Energy Schedule, which is passed along for Optimize Schedule. Now, with all the pieces in place — the Optimization Horizon, Load Prediction, Generation Prediction, and Price Prediction — the Prosumer can perform Optimize Schedule and create the final Energy Schedule. This schedule then goes to the Grid Operator for Validate Schedule.

At this point, the Grid Operator, having received both the Energy Schedule and Optimization Horizon, performs Validate Schedule, which results in a Boolean object. Depending on whether this Boolean is true or false, things either continue or wrap up. If it's false, the Boolean is passed to Request Optimization, and the Grid Operator creates a new Optimization Request, which starts the process all over again with the Prosumer's Accept Optimization Request.

If the Boolean is true, the workflow ends. 
 Let’s think step by step: does the practical implementation of the Workflow fulfill all the rules stated initially? 
If no rules are broken, the practical implementation can be considered as valid. Please state for every individual rule if and why it is fulfilled or not. 
Also provide a brief summary as to whether all rules are fulfilled. 
 Answer: ;;; 1. Every action Accept Optimization Request must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Optimization Request.
- Fulfilled: The Prosumer performs Accept Optimization Request with the input of Optimization Request.

2. There must be at least one action Accept Optimization Request in the workflow.
- Fulfilled: The Prosumer performs Accept Optimization Request.

3. Every action Aggregate Flexibility must have at least one input and all inputs must be of the type Energy Schedule.
- Not fulfilled: There is no action named Aggregate Flexibility in the practical implementation.

4. Every action Aggregate Flexibility may only be performed by the actor Aggregator.
- Not applicable: Since Aggregate Flexibility action is not present, this rule does not apply.

5. Every action Determine System State must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type System State.
- Fulfilled: The Prosumer performs Determine System State with the output of System State.

6. Every action Accept Offer may only be performed by the actor Energy Market.
- Not fulfilled: There is no action named Accept Offer in the practical implementation.

7. Every action Clear Market may only be performed by the actor Energy Market.
- Not fulfilled: There is no action named Clear Market in the practical implementation.

8. There must be at least one action Log Information in the workflow.
- Fulfilled: The Grid Operator performs Log Information.

9. Every action Optimize Schedule must have one input of the type Optimization Horizon.
- Fulfilled: The Prosumer performs Optimize Schedule with the input of Optimization Horizon.

10. Every action Optimize Schedule must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Energy Schedule.
- Fulfilled: The Prosumer performs Optimize Schedule with the output of Energy Schedule.

11. Every action Predict Generation may only be performed by the actor Prediction Services.
- Fulfilled: Prediction Services perform Predict Generation.

12. Every action Predict Price may only be performed by the actor Prediction Services.
- Not fulfilled: The Grid Operator performs Predict Price.

13. Every action Predict Load must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Load Prediction.
- Fulfilled: Prediction Services perform Predict Load with the output of Load Prediction.

14. Every action Predict Price must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Optimization Horizon.
- Not fulfilled: The Grid Operator performs Predict Price with the input of Optimization Horizon.

15. The Prosumer must perform at least one action.
- Fulfilled: The Prosumer performs Accept Optimization Request, Determine System State, and Set Optimization Horizon.

16. There must be at least one action Set Optimization Horizon in the workflow.
- Fulfilled: The Prosumer performs Set Optimization Horizon.

17. Every action Set Optimization Horizon must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Optimization Horizon.
