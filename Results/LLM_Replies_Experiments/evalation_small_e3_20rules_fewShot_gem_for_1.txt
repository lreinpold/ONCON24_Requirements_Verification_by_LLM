	"The following is a specification of a technical workflow in a Smart Grid context. The workflow consists of actions, which represent the different steps of the workflow. Each action is executed by an actor. Objects are exchanged between various actions. The actions, actors and objects of the workflow are described in the following. Actors, objects, and actions must adhere to specific rules, which are also described in the following. Please read the specification so I can subsequently ask you questions about it. 
The workflow is called Smart Grid Optimization Workflow. 
The actors that can be involved in the workflow are Energy Market, Energy Supplier and Aggregator.
The workflow can consist of the objects Market Clearing Result, Sensor Reading, Bid, Flexibility, and Control Signal. 
The workflow can consist of the actions Accept Offer, Clear Market, Place Bid, Receive Clearing Results, Determine Flexibility, Communicate Flexibility, and Aggregate Flexibility. 

The following rules must be adhered to: 
Every action Clear Market must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Market Clearing Results.
Every action Place Bid must have at least one output and accepts only inputs of the type Bid. 
Every Action Receive Clearing Results may only be performed by the actor Aggregator.
Every action Receive Clearing Results must have at least one input that accepts the type Market Clearing Results. 
There must be at least one action Clear Market in the workflow.  
Every action 'Accept Offer may only be performed by the Energy Market
The action Clear Market may only be performed by the Energy Market. 
Every action Aggregate Flexibility may only be performed by the actor Aggregator. 
Every action Communicate Flexibility must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Flexibility.
Every action Receive Clearing Results must have at least one input that accepts the type Market Clearing Results. 
Every action Aggregate Flexibility must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Flexibility. 
There must be at least one action Aggregate Flexibility in the Workflow. 

The following is a description of a practical implementation of the Smart Grid Optimization Workflow. 
Once the workflow is started the workflow is started, the Energy Market performs the action Clear Market, and an output object Market Clearing Results is created and sent as input for the action Receive Clearing Results. 
Subsequently, the Energy Market performs the action Receive Clearing Results.
Subsequently, the Aggregator performs the action Determine Flexibility. 
Subsequently, the Aggregator performs the action Aggregate Flexibility.
Subsequently, the workflow terminates. 

Lets think step by step: does the practical implementation of the Workflow fulfill all the rules stated initially? 
If no rules are broken, the practical implementation can be considered as valid. Please state for every individual rule if it is fulfilled or not. Also provide a brief summary as to whether all rules are fulfilled."

Actors, objects, and actions must adhere to specific rules, which are also described in the following. Please read the specification so I can subsequently ask you questions about it. 
The workflow is called Smart Grid Optimization Workflow. 
The actors involved in the workflow are Prosumer, Energy Market, Prediction Services, Aggregator, and Grid Operator.
The workflow can consist of the objects Optimization Request, Market Offer, Energy Schedule, Optimization Horizon, System State, Market Clearing Results, Load Prediction, Price Prediction, Generation Prediction and Boolean. 
The workflow consists of the actions Accept Optimization Request, Clear Market, Set Optimization Horizon, Determine System State, Accept Offer, Predict Load, Predict Generation, Predict Price, Optimize Schedule, Aggregate Flexibility, Validate Schedule, Request Optimization, and Log Information. 

 The following rules must be adhered to: 
 A distinction  between valid and invalid Objects must be made at some point within the workflow.  \n Every action Determine System State must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type System State. \n Every action Predict Generation must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Generation Prediction. \n Every action Log Information may only be performed by the Grid Operator. \n The Grid Operator must perform at least one action \n Every action Validate Schedule may only be performed by the actor Grid Operator. \n Every action Log Information must have at least one input that accepts the type Energy Schedule. \n The action Log Information may not have an output of the type Energy Schedule. \n There must be at least one action Log Information in the workflow.  \n The action Optimize Schedule may not have an input that accepts the type Energy Schedule. \n Every action Optimize Schedule must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Energy Schedule. \n There must be at least one action Optimize Schedule in the workflow.  \n Every action Predict Load may only be performed by the actor Prediction Services. \n Every action Predict Load must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Optimization Horizon. \n Every action Optimize Schedule may only be performed by the Prosumer. \n The Prosumer must perform at least one action. \n The workflow must terminate immediately after the action Log Information has been performed. \n Every action Validate Schedule must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Energy Schedule. \n The action Validate Schedule may not have an output of the type Boolean. \n There must be at least one action Validate Schedule in the workflow.   
  The following is a description of a practical implementation of the Smart Grid Optimization Workflow. 
Once the workflow is started the Prosumer performs the action Optimize Schedule, and an output object Energy Schedule is created and sent to the Grid Operator as input for the action Log Information.
Subsequently, the Prosumer performs the action Validate Schedule. 
If the output of the action Validate Schedule is invalid, the Prosumer performs the action Optimize Schedule again. 
If the output of the action Validate Schedule is valid, the Grid Operator performs the action Log Information. 
If the Grid Operator performs the action Log Information, the Log Information action takes as input the Energy Schedule created by the Optimize Schedule action. 
Subsequently, the workflow terminates.  
 Let’s think step by step: does the practical implementation of the Workflow fulfill all the rules stated initially? 
If no rules are broken, the practical implementation can be considered as valid. Please state for every individual rule if and why it is fulfilled or not.
