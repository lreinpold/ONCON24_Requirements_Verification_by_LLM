	"The following is a specification of a technical workflow in a Smart Grid context. The workflow consists of actions, which represent the different steps of the workflow. Each action is executed by an actor. Objects are exchanged between various actions. The actions, actors and objects of the workflow are described in the following. Actors, objects, and actions must adhere to specific rules, which are also described in the following. Please read the specification so I can subsequently ask you questions about it. 
The workflow is called Smart Grid Optimization Workflow. 
The actors that can be involved in the workflow are Energy Market, Energy Supplier and Aggregator.
The workflow can consist of the objects Market Clearing Result, Sensor Reading, Bid, Flexibility, and Control Signal. 
The workflow can consist of the actions Accept Offer, Clear Market, Place Bid, Receive Clearing Results, Determine Flexibility, Communicate Flexibility, and Aggregate Flexibility. 

The following rules must be adhered to: 
Every action Clear Market must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Market Clearing Results.
Every action Place Bid must have at least one output and accepts only inputs of the type Bid. 
Every Action Receive Clearing Results may only be performed by the actor Aggregator.
Every action Receive Clearing Results must have at least one input that accepts the type Market Clearing Results. 
There must be at least one action Clear Market in the workflow.  
Every action 'Accept Offer may only be performed by the Energy Market
The action Clear Market may only be performed by the Energy Market. 
Every action Aggregate Flexibility may only be performed by the actor Aggregator. 
Every action Communicate Flexibility must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Flexibility.
Every action Receive Clearing Results must have at least one input that accepts the type Market Clearing Results. 
Every action Aggregate Flexibility must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Flexibility. 
There must be at least one action Aggregate Flexibility in the Workflow. 

The following is a description of a practical implementation of the Smart Grid Optimization Workflow. 
Once the workflow is started the workflow is started, the Energy Market performs the action Clear Market, and an output object Market Clearing Results is created and sent as input for the action Receive Clearing Results. 
Subsequently, the Energy Market performs the action Receive Clearing Results.
Subsequently, the Aggregator performs the action Determine Flexibility. 
Subsequently, the Aggregator performs the action Aggregate Flexibility.
Subsequently, the workflow terminates. 

Lets think step by step: does the practical implementation of the Workflow fulfill all the rules stated initially? 
If no rules are broken, the practical implementation can be considered as valid. Please state for every individual rule if it is fulfilled or not. Also provide a brief summary as to whether all rules are fulfilled."

 The following is a specification of a technical workflow in a Smart Grid context. The workflow consists of actions, which represent the different steps of the workflow. Each action is executed by an actor. Objects are exchanged between various actions. The actions, actors and objects of the workflow are described in the following. Actors, objects, and actions must adhere to specific rules, which are also described in the following. Please read the specification so I can subsequently ask you questions about it. 
The workflow is called Smart Grid Optimization Workflow. 
The actors involved in the workflow are Prosumer, Energy Market, Prediction Services, Aggregator, and Grid Operator.
The workflow can consist of the objects Optimization Request, Market Offer, Energy Schedule, Optimization Horizon, System State, Market Clearing Results, Load Prediction, Price Prediction, Generation Prediction and Boolean. 
The workflow consists of the actions Accept Optimization Request, Clear Market, Set Optimization Horizon, Determine System State, Accept Offer, Predict Load, Predict Generation, Predict Price, Optimize Schedule, Aggregate Flexibility, Validate Schedule, Request Optimization, and Log Information. 

 The following rules must be adhered to: 
 Every action Accept Offer must have at least one input and all input must be of the type Market Offer.  \n There must be at least one action AcceptOptimization Request in the workflow.  \n Every action Determine System State must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type System State. \n Every action Predict Generation must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Optimization Horizon. \n Every action Log Information must have at least one input that accepts the type Energy Schedule. \n Every action Optimize Schedule must have one input of the type Optimization Horizon. \n Every action Optimize Schedule must have at least one input of the type System State. \n Every action Predict Load may only be performed by the actor Prediction Services. \n Every action Predict Price must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Optimization Horizon. \n Every action Validate Schedule must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Energy Schedule.  
  The following is a description of a practical implementation of the Smart Grid Optimization Workflow. 

 The Smart Grid Optimization Workflow kicks off when an Optimization Request object is created. This Optimization Request is then sent to the Prosumer, who takes it in and performs the action Accept Optimization Request.

Next, the Prosumer goes on to do two things: Determine System State and Set Optimization Horizon. When setting the horizon, an Optimization Horizon object is generated. This object stays with the Prosumer as input for Optimize Schedule, but it's also shared with Prediction Services for the actions Predict Generation and Predict Load, and with the Grid Operator for Predict Price and Validate Schedule.

Once Prediction Services get the Optimization Horizon, they carry out Predict Generation, which results in a Generation Prediction being created and sent back to the Prosumer for Optimize Schedule. Meanwhile, the Grid Operator uses the Optimization Horizon to run Predict Price, which produces a Price Prediction that also goes to the Prosumer. Likewise, Prediction Services handle Predict Load, resulting in a Load Prediction sent to the Prosumer.

When the Prosumer runs Determine System State, it creates an Energy Schedule, which is passed along for Optimize Schedule. Now, with all the pieces in place — the Optimization Horizon, Load Prediction, Generation Prediction, and Price Prediction — the Prosumer can perform Optimize Schedule and create the final Energy Schedule. This schedule then goes to the Grid Operator for Validate Schedule.

At this point, the Grid Operator, having received both the Energy Schedule and Optimization Horizon, performs Validate Schedule, which results in a Boolean object. Depending on whether this Boolean is true or false, things either continue or wrap up. If it's false, the Boolean is passed to Request Optimization, and the Grid Operator creates a new Optimization Request, which starts the process all over again with the Prosumer's Accept Optimization Request.

If the Boolean is true, the workflow ends. 
 Let’s think step by step: does the practical implementation of the Workflow fulfill all the rules stated initially? 
If no rules are broken, the practical implementation can be considered as valid. Please state for every individual rule if and why it is fulfilled or not. 
Also provide a brief summary as to whether all rules are fulfilled.
