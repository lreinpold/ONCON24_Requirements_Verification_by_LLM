 The following is a specification of a technical workflow in a Smart Grid context. The workflow consists of actions, which represent the different steps of the workflow. Each action is executed by an actor. Objects are exchanged between various actions. The actions, actors and objects of the workflow are described in the following. Actors, objects, and actions must adhere to specific rules, which are also described in the following. Please read the specification so I can subsequently ask you questions about it. 
The workflow is called Smart Grid Optimization Workflow. 
The actors involved in the workflow are Prosumer, Energy Market, Prediction Services, Aggregator, and Grid Operator.
The workflow can consist of the objects Optimization Request, Market Offer, Energy Schedule, Optimization Horizon, System State, Market Clearing Results, Load Prediction, Price Prediction, Generation Prediction and Boolean. 
The workflow consists of the actions Accept Optimization Request, Clear Market, Set Optimization Horizon, Determine System State, Accept Offer, Predict Load, Predict Generation, Predict Price, Optimize Schedule, Aggregate Flexibility, Validate Schedule, Request Optimization, and Log Information. 

 The following rules must be adhered to: 
 Every action Accept Offer must have at least one input and all input must be of the type Market Offer.  \n Every action Accept Optimization Request must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Optimization Request. \n There must be at least one action AcceptOptimization Request in the workflow.  \n Every action Aggregate Flexibility must have at least one input and all input must be of the type Energy Schedule.  \n Every action Determine System State must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type System State. \n Every action Accept Offer may only be performed by the actor Energy Market. \n Every action Clear Market may only be performed by the actor Energy Market. \n Every action Predict Generation must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Optimization Horizon. \n Every action Predict Generation must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Generation Prediction. \n Every action Log Information may only be performed by the Grid Operator. \n Every action Log Information must have at least one input that accepts the type Energy Schedule. \n There must be at least one action Optimize Schedule in the workflow.  \n Every action Predict Generation may only be performed by the actor Prediction Services. \n Every action Predict Price may only be performed by the actor Prediction Services. \n Every action Predict Load must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Optimization Horizon. \n Every action Predict Load must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Load Prediction. \n Every action Predict Price must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Optimization Horizon. \n The Prosumer must perform at least one action. \n Every action Validate Schedule must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Energy Schedule. \n Every action Validate Schedule must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Boolean.   
  The following is a description of a practical implementation of the Smart Grid Optimization Workflow: \n The Smart Grid Optimization Workflow kicks off when an Optimization Request is created. This request is sent to the Prosumer for them to decide whether to accept it. The Prosumer reviews and performs the action Accept Optimization Request.

Next, the Prosumer carries out the actions Determine System State and Set Optimization Horizon. When they set the optimization horizon, it generates an Optimization Horizon object. This object stays with the Prosumer to optimize their schedule and is also sent over to Prediction Services so they can handle tasks like Predict Generation, Predict Load, and Predict Price.

Once the Prediction Services get the Optimization Horizon object, they predict the generation and create a Generation Prediction that goes back to the Prosumer for optimizing their schedule. Similarly, they predict the price and send back a Price Prediction and then predict the load, creating a Load Prediction object that is also returned to the Prosumer.

Meanwhile, the Prosumer determines the system state, which results in a System State object. That, too, is used as input for the action Optimize Schedule. With all these inputs — the Optimization Horizon, Load Prediction, Generation Prediction, System State, and Price Prediction — the Prosumer can now perform the action Optimize Schedule and generate an Energy Schedule.

This Energy Schedule is sent over to the Grid Operator, who takes care of the validation process through the action Validate Schedule. After validating, a Boolean object is created. This Boolean can either stay with the Grid Operator for logging or trigger a request for further optimization, depending on whether it’s true or false.

If the Boolean turns out to be false, the Grid Operator performs the action Request Optimization, generating a new Optimization Request, which loops back to the Prosumer for them to review again. If the Boolean is true, it proceeds to the action Log Information.

Once the Grid Operator logs the information using the Boolean and Energy Schedule, the workflow wraps up.
