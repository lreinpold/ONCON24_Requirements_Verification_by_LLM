	"The following is a specification of a technical workflow in a Smart Grid context. The workflow consists of actions, which represent the different steps of the workflow. Each action is executed by an actor. Objects are exchanged between various actions. The actions, actors and objects of the workflow are described in the following. Actors, objects, and actions must adhere to specific rules, which are also described in the following. Please read the specification so I can subsequently ask you questions about it. 
The workflow is called Smart Grid Optimization Workflow. 
The actors that can be involved in the workflow are Energy Market, Energy Supplier and Aggregator.
The workflow can consist of the objects Market Clearing Result, Sensor Reading, Bid, Flexibility, and Control Signal. 
The workflow can consist of the actions Accept Offer, Clear Market, Place Bid, Receive Clearing Results, Determine Flexibility, Communicate Flexibility, and Aggregate Flexibility. 

The following rules must be adhered to: 
Every action Clear Market must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Market Clearing Results.
Every action Place Bid must have at least one output and accepts only inputs of the type Bid. 
Every Action Receive Clearing Results may only be performed by the actor Aggregator.
Every action Receive Clearing Results must have at least one input that accepts the type Market Clearing Results. 
There must be at least one action Clear Market in the workflow.  
Every action 'Accept Offer may only be performed by the Energy Market
The action Clear Market may only be performed by the Energy Market. 
Every action Aggregate Flexibility may only be performed by the actor Aggregator. 
Every action Communicate Flexibility must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Flexibility.
Every action Receive Clearing Results must have at least one input that accepts the type Market Clearing Results. 
Every action Aggregate Flexibility must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Flexibility. 
There must be at least one action Aggregate Flexibility in the Workflow. 

The following is a description of a practical implementation of the Smart Grid Optimization Workflow. 
Once the workflow is started the workflow is started, the Energy Market performs the action Clear Market, and an output object Market Clearing Results is created and sent as input for the action Receive Clearing Results. 
Subsequently, the Energy Market performs the action Receive Clearing Results.
Subsequently, the Aggregator performs the action Determine Flexibility. 
Subsequently, the Aggregator performs the action Aggregate Flexibility.
Subsequently, the workflow terminates. 

Lets think step by step: does the practical implementation of the Workflow fulfill all the rules stated initially? 
If no rules are broken, the practical implementation can be considered as valid. Please state for every individual rule if it is fulfilled or not. Also provide a brief summary as to whether all rules are fulfilled."

- Rules 3 and 11 are not fulfilled.

**Conclusion:**
The practical implementation of the Smart Grid Optimization Workflow does not fulfill all the specified rules. Specifically, it violates rules 3 and 11. Therefore, the practical implementation cannot be considered valid as it stands."

  The following is a description of a practical implementation of the Smart Grid Optimization Workflow. 
The practical implementation of the Smart Grid Optimization Workflow starts when an object Optimization Request is created. 
The Optimization Request object is sent to the Prosumer as input for the action Accept Optimization Request. 
The Prosumer performs the action Accept Optimization Request. 
Subsequently, the Prosumer performs the actions Determine System State and Set Optimization Horizon. 
In performing the action Set Optimization Horizon an output object Optimization Horizon is created which remains with the Prosumer as input for the action Optimize Schedule and is also sent to Prediction Services as input for the actions Predict Generation and Predict Price.
Upon receiving the Optimization Horizon object as input, Prediction Services perform the action Predict Generation, and an output object Generation Prediction is created and sent to the Prosumer as input for the action Optimize Schedule. 
Upon receiving the Optimization Horizon object as input, Prediction Services perform the action Predict Price, and an output object Price Prediction is created and sent to the Prosumer as input for the action Optimize Schedule. 
In performing the action Determine System State an output object System State is created which is sent to the Grid Operator as input for the action Predict Load.
Upon receiving the System State object as input, the Grid Operator performs the action Predict Load, and an output object Load Prediction is created and sent to the Prosumer as input for the action Optimize Schedule. 
Upon receiving the input objects Optimization Horizon, Load Prediction, Generation Prediction, and Price Prediction, the Prosumer performs the action Optimize Schedule, and an output object Energy schedule is created and sent to the Grid Operator as input for the actions Validate Schedule and Log Information. 
Upon receiving the Energy Schedule object as input, the Grid Operator performs the action Validate Schedule, and an output object Boolean is created which remains with the Grid Operator and can be used as input for the action Request Optimization or Log Information depending on the value of the Boolean object.
If the Boolean Object is equal to false, the Boolean Object is sent to the action Request Optimization. 
Upon receiving the Boolean object as input, the Grid Operator performs the action Request Optimization, and an output object Optimization Request is created and sent to the Prosumer as input for the aforementioned action Accept Optimization Request. 
If the Boolean Object is equal to true, the Boolean Object is sent as input for the action Log Information. 
Upon receiving the Boolean and Energy Schedule objects as input, the Grid Operator performs the action Log Information. 
Subsequently, the workflow terminates.  
 Let’s think step by step: does the practical implementation of the Workflow fulfill all the rules stated initially? 
If no rules are broken, the practical implementation can be considered as valid. Please state for every individual rule if and why it is fulfilled or not. 
Also provide a brief summary as to whether all rules are fulfilled.
