 The following is a specification of a technical workflow in a Smart Grid context. The workflow consists of actions, which represent the different steps of the workflow. Each action is executed by an actor. Objects are exchanged between various actions. The actions, actors and objects of the workflow are described in the following. Actors, objects, and actions must adhere to specific rules, which are also described in the following. Please read the specification so I can subsequently ask you questions about it. 
The workflow is called Smart Grid Optimization Workflow. 
The actors involved in the workflow are Prosumer, Energy Market, Prediction Services, Aggregator, and Grid Operator.
The workflow can consist of the objects Optimization Request, Market Offer, Energy Schedule, Optimization Horizon, System State, Market Clearing Results, Load Prediction, Price Prediction, Generation Prediction and Boolean. 
The workflow consists of the actions Accept Optimization Request, Clear Market, Set Optimization Horizon, Determine System State, Accept Offer, Predict Load, Predict Generation, Predict Price, Optimize Schedule, Aggregate Flexibility, Validate Schedule, Request Optimization, and Log Information. 

 The following rules must be adhered to: 
 Every action Accept Offer must have at least one input and all input must be of the type Market Offer.  \n Every action Accept Optimization Request must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Optimization Request. \n There must be at least one action AcceptOptimization Request in the workflow.  \n Every action Aggregate Flexibility must have at least one input and all input must be of the type Energy Schedule.  \n Every action Determine System State must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type System State. \n Every action Accept Offer may only be performed by the actor Energy Market. \n Every action Clear Market may only be performed by the actor Energy Market. \n Every action Predict Generation must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Optimization Horizon. \n Every action Predict Generation must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Generation Prediction. \n Every action Log Information may only be performed by the Grid Operator. \n Every action Log Information must have at least one input that accepts the type Energy Schedule. \n There must be at least one action Optimize Schedule in the workflow.  \n Every action Predict Generation may only be performed by the actor Prediction Services. \n Every action Predict Price may only be performed by the actor Prediction Services. \n Every action Predict Load must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Optimization Horizon. \n Every action Predict Load must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Load Prediction. \n Every action Predict Price must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Optimization Horizon. \n The Prosumer must perform at least one action. \n Every action Validate Schedule must have at least one input and accepts only inputs of the type Energy Schedule. \n Every action Validate Schedule must have at least one output and all outputs must be of the type Boolean.   
  The following is a description of a practical implementation of the Smart Grid Optimization Workflow. 
The practical implementation of the Smart Grid Optimization Workflow starts when an object Optimization Request is created. 
The Optimization Request object is sent to the Prosumer as input for the action Accept Optimization Request. 
The Prosumer performs the action Accept Optimization Request. 
Subsequently, the Prosumer performs the actions Determine System State and Set Optimization Horizon. 
In performing the action Set Optimization Horizon an output object Optimization Horizon is created which remains with the Prosumer as input for the action Optimize Schedule and is also sent to Prediction Services as input for the actions Predict Generation, Predict Load, and Predict Price.
Upon receiving the Optimization Horizon object as input, Prediction Services perform the action Predict Generation, and an output object Generation Prediction is created and sent to the Prosumer as input for the action Optimize Schedule. 
Upon receiving the Optimization Horizon object as input, Prediction Services perform the action Predict Price, and an output object Price Prediction is created and sent to the Prosumer as input for the action Optimize Schedule. 
Upon receiving the Optimization Horizon object as input, Prediction Services perform the action Predict Load, and an output object Load Prediction is created and sent to the Prosumer as input for the action Optimize Schedule. 
In performing the action Determine System State an output object System State is created which is sent as input for the action Optimize Schedule.
Upon receiving the input objects Optimization Horizon, Load Prediction, Generation Prediction, System State, and Price Prediction, the Prosumer performs the action Optimize Schedule, and an output object Energy schedule is created and sent to the Grid Operator as input for the actions Validate Schedule and Log Information. 
Upon receiving the Energy Schedule object as input, the Grid Operator performs the action Validate Schedule, and an output object Boolean is created which remains with the Grid Operator and can be used as input for the action Request Optimization or Log Information depending on the value of the Boolean object.
If the Boolean object is equal to false, the Boolean object is sent to the action Request Optimization. 
Upon receiving the Boolean object as input, the Grid Operator performs the action Request Optimization, and an output object Optimization Request is created and sent to the Prosumer as input for the aforementioned action Accept Optimization Request. 
If the Boolean Object is equal to true, the Boolean Object is sent as input for the action Log Information. 
Upon receiving the Boolean and Energy Schedule objects as input, the Grid Operator performs the action Log Information. 
Subsequently, the workflow terminates.
