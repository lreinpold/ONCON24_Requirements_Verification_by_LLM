Experimental results are in the 'Results' folder. Tabulated results are in the excel File 'experimentResults_summarized_final.xlxs', while individual textual replies by LLMs are in the 'LLM_Replies_Experiments' subfolder.

The code to run the experiments is the python script activityDiagramExperiments.py. It requires the presence of the two other files in the 'Code' folder. 

The formal models including activity diagrams and OCL-Constraints are in the SysML subfolder. The file might require the 'Magic Systems of Systems Architect'.
